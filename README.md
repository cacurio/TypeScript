    # TypeScript
    Best Practices for Writing Readable and Maintainable Code in JavaScript with the best of these superset features of JavaScript. Strictly speaking, typeScript transpiled / transcompiled to Javascript.

        Transpilation: high-level programming language to another high-level programming language.
        Compilation: high-level programming language to low-level programming language or low-level intermediate language (e.g., il bytecode, il p-Code, binary Julia / Golang / Rust, etc).

    ## Type Annotations (:Type)
    Be able to declare or annotate type values for example (variables, constants, arrays, function parameters even function return values) in order to make your source code a lot more readable and error-free.

    ## Type Aliases
    Be able to rename pre-existing data types for example (primitive types, custom classes, unions, and generics) in order to achieve a more legible/readable and maintainable code.

    ## Union Types
    Be able to have more than one data type for a value this includes variables, constants, function parameters and even return values.

    ## Object Literals
    Be able to achieve more natural control of flow as an alternative to switch statements. Objects are more extensible, maintainable. Object literals can contain functions as well as any other Object type so giving more flexibility.

    ### Anonymous Functions (arrow function, function literal, lambda abstraction, lambda function, lambda expression or closures)
    Be able to have a function that was declared without any named identifier, these are often arguments being passed to higher-order functions, or used to compose the result of a higher-order. 
    They are named too (arrow function, function literal, lambda abstraction, lambda function, lambda expression, or closures).

    ## Generic Types
    Be able to abstract types / to build reusable components in order to create flexible and scalable components that work with any data type and not restrict to one type.

    ## Extensions
